## Overview

Thanks for checking out this front-end project which was inspired by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and i did the best i could to provide you with the cleanest and accurate codes for different devices. I hope this challenge codings help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Remember that "Every day is a learning day", so let's checkout the requirements to start such project

### The challenge

In his project you should be able to:

## My process

### Where to find resources

We know what we need first, yes! you are right, the design file. So let's checkout [Fimga](https://www.figma.com/file/bniymsHXiBth9dQbpyBRuQ/3-column-preview-card-component?node-id=0%3A1) to find even the smallest details about the style requirements of this project such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin` as well as finding all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. `color palette` is also available in figma file to guide you to choose the accurate colors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (SASS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try. However, i wrote this design with simple html5 and sass and made it responsive for all the devices, since my users should be able to: View the optimal layout and hover or active states depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

This projects helped me being more familiar with the details of html and css, and use my sass knowledge as well to create a responsive project with small details on colors,sizes and so on. I also tried some fruitful tools such as css stripes to help with SEO and speed concepts on the project as well.

To see parts of my codes and see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <section class="main__container">
         <div class="main__container--first-column">
            <div>
               <div class="bg-icon_sedans"></div>
               <h1>SEDANS</h1>
               <p>Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for cruising in the city or on your next road trip.</p>
            </div>
            <button>Learn More</button>
         </div>
  </section>
```
```css
.bg-icon_sedans {
   width: 64px; height: 40px;
   background: url('../images/css_sprites.png') -10px -70px;
}
.main__container {
   max-width: 920px;

   h1 {
      font-family: "BigShouldersDisplay";
   }

   p {
      color: $primary-color;
      line-height: 25px;
   }

   button {
      font-size: 15px;
      background-color: $primary-color;
      cursor: pointer;
      transition: all 0.35s ease-in-out;

      &:hover {
         border: 2px solid $white;
         background-color: transparent;
         color: $white;
      }

      &.active {
         border: 2px solid $white;
         background-color: transparent;
         color: $white;
      }
   }

   &--first-column {
      height: 500px;
   }

   &--second-column {
      background-color: $color-second-column;
   }

   &--third-column {
      display: flex;

      button {
         color: $color-third-column;
      }
   }

```

### Continued development

In my future projects, not only i am going to focus on improving my basic knowledge of front end development (html and css), but also i will make it more dynamic and use javascript so as to create cooler projects. I will also try to be much more familiar with UI design so as to better understand my clients needs and requirements.
